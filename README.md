# ETC5242: Group Assignment - Grades Analysis (Modelling Distributions, Randomisation Techniques and Bayesian Statistics)

This repository contains the work and materials for Assignment 1 of the ETC5242 unit (Statistical Thinking).

This is a report on analyzing the distribution and outcomes of a hypothetical new quiz designed for a management class, with the goal of evaluating whether the quiz was challenging enough without being overly difficult. The dataset provided includes grades for 200 students, which we analyze using both descriptive and Bayesian statistical methods.

## Tasks and Objectives:
1. **Modelling Distributions:** We fit both normal and beta distributions to the quiz grades to determine the most suitable model and utilize bootstrap techniques to assess model reliability.
2. **Randomisation Techniques:** We perform a permutation test to compare quiz performance between postgraduate and undergraduate students, aiming to determine if one group outperformed the other.
3. **Bayesian Statistics:** Bayesian analysis is applied to estimate the proportion of students who "passed" the quiz among postgraduates and undergraduates, using different prior distributions to influence the analysis.

## Key Findings and Conclusions:
- The report details the statistical methods used, the results obtained from these methods, and interprets these results in the context of the quiz's design goals.
- Visualizations are included to illustrate the distribution of grades and the results of the Bayesian analysis.
- The report concludes with recommendations on how the quiz might be improved based on the statistical findings.

This work is intended to provide a comprehensive statistical overview of the quiz performance, offering insights into both the effectiveness of the quiz design and the differences in performance between student cohorts.
